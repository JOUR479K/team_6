From the start of the group project, we all brought 3 different ideas to the table and then decided to go with a project revolving around Instagram. Here are the problems we have run into thus far:

Initially our idea was very broad (ex: we wanted to create something that would show the top most visted places in each of the 50 states)
We didn't know what codes to use.
We were unsure of what to create using the code (ex: scraper, bot, etc.)
We didn't have an API token.
We tried out different codes that often led to dead ends.
There were a lot of problems getting the code to run in Python once we found working code and are still continuously struggling with that.
