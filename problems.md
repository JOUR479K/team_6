One problem we've encountered with our project is how to go about creating the tool that will help us determine the most Instagrammed locations. We are unsure if we need to create a website in addition to the app, or create some other format.

Another issue we've had is how to make sure that the page constantly updates the amount of times a place has been tagged on Instagram.

How we've tried to resolve our issues: As of right now, we're not completely sure how to go about trying to resolve these problems. We have these ideas but don't know the most efficient way to make them happen.
