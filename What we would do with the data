What we would with the data:
With the below data we were able to produce a CSV file. Because the data output gives both latitudes and longitudes, we can geocode the locations we requested from Instagram. We can then upload this file to Google Fusion Tables and map the locations from the sheet using the geocodes we found. This map can act as a graphic for our story. A story on the topic can answer the overarching question of which college park bar’s location is tagged the most on Instagram by looking at the most recent posts. Is there a trend in when they are tagged? Further analysis of the information could help a reporter figure out what types of pictures people most often take at each bar - be it food, people or the location itself. We can also do more research on who is tagging the locations. Are the Instagrammers townies or Maryland students? Additional interviews with the location’s managers could answer whether social media tagging like the data pulled helps bring customers to the bars.
