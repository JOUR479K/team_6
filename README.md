# team_6 Data Story Ideas
  1. We would research how many students were admitted to the Merrill College when they applied to UMD, versus once they were second-semester freshmen. We would do this for the past ten years and see if there was a trend.
  
  2. We would research which states in the U.S. are visited the most. We would then take the top ten states and figure out when the most popular visiting seasons are and why.
  
  3. We would research how many Chipotle restaurants were shut down across the nation, where these restaurants are and when they closed. 


Revised Story Ideas

1. Admitted Merrill College Students

Our group would like to find the data about how many students were admitted to the Merrill College when they applied to the university vs. when they were second-semester freshmen. We would do this to see if there was a trend over a span of ten years, but also see how many applicants there were compared to how many were accepted each semester. This could be helpful data to determine if there was a higher interest in majoring in journalism in certain years more so than others, and could allow us to think about current events that might have led to students' interest in careers in journalism. Lastly, we could do a comparison of how many multiplatform applicants vs. broadcast applicants there were over the ten year span. 


2. Most Visited Places in U.S. According To Instagram

Times, Business Insider and Buzzfeed all did similar articles. They pulled data from the locations of people across the nation, determining the most visited places by the amounts of tagging the specific location got. We could do research and find the top two-to-three places people Instagram in each state. We could then build something that calculates how many times that location tag (or a few versions of the tag) were used. We could narrow down the timeframe to last month or last year.
