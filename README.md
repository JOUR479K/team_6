# team_6 Data Story Ideas
  1. We would research how many students were admitted to the Merrill College when they applied to UMD, versus once they were second-semester freshmen. We would do this for the past ten years and see if there was a trend.
  
  2. We would research which states in the U.S. are visited the most. We would then take the top ten states and figure out when the most popular visiting seasons are and why.
  
  3. We would research how many Chipotle restaurants were shut down across the nation, where these restaurants are and when they closed. 


Revised Story Ideas

1. Admitted Merrill College Students


2. Most Visited Places in U.S. According To Instagram

Times, Business Insider and Buzzfeed all did similar articles. They pulling data from the locations people acorss the antion chose tot ag their pictures. We could do research and find the top two-to-three places people Instagram in each state. We could then build something that calculates how many times that location tag (or a few versions of the tag) were used. We could narrow down the timeframe to last month or last year.
