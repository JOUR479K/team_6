# team_6 Data Story Ideas
  1. We would research how many students were admitted to the Merrill College when they applied to UMD, versus once they were second-semester freshmen. We would do this for the past ten years and see if there was a trend.
  
  2. We would research which states in the U.S. are visited the most. We would then take the top ten states and figure out when the most popular visiting seasons are and why.
  
  3. We would research how many Chipotle restaurants were shut down across the nation, where these restaurants are and when they closed.
